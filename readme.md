## Overview
The RL78EMU is an emulator for the Renesas RL78 series of microcontrollers. It aims to provide an accurate simulation of RL78 microcontrollers, allowing developers to test their firmware and software without the need for physical hardware.

### Features
- Emulation of RL78 CPU (Core 1, Core 2, Core 3).
- Support for various RL78 peripherals, including timers, UART, SPI, I2C, ADC, and more.
- CLI (Command-Line Interface) for easy interaction and debugging.
- GUI (Graphical User Interface) for a user-friendly emulation experience (planned feature).
- Unix/Posix-platform support.

## Contributing
At this time, I am not actively seeking contributions to the RL78EMU project. I appreciate your interest and enthusiasm for contributing to the project.

The reason for not actively seeking contributions is that I currently do not have well-defined ground rules and guidelines in place for contributors. I want to ensure that the contribution process is clear, fair, and productive for everyone involved.

However, I am always open to feedback, bug reports, and feature requests. If you encounter issues with the project or have ideas for improvements, please feel free to report in this project's repo issues page.

I value your interest in the project, and I may consider establishing contribution guidelines in the future. Until then, thank you for your understanding and support.
